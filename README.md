# Hobby Engine

## !! WARNING !! Very early in development

A game engine made to be simple. Primarily a 2D engine, though 3D is not off the table as a feature.
<br>
This engine should do all the hard/annoying stuff for you. Things like rendering, audio, input, object processing, physics. All the easy stuff should be left to the user.
<br>
The name comes from the species of bird known as Hobbies, and the fact that this is, in fact, a hobby project.
<br>
Anyway, please, stare at the logo:
